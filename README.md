## SimpleNotes
"Simple Notes" is a notepad where you can create, save and read basic notes.

This is a UWP (Universal Windows Platform), targeting Windows 10 Fall Creators Update to use Acrylic Material brushes for UI controls.

UI and UX are far from good, but they were not the goal of creating this application.

The application has a basic implementation of MVVM design pattern.

There are some features to add in the future:
* ~~Implement ICommand~~
* ~~Remove all code behind~~
* ~~Create new application icon~~
* ~~Redesign GUI layer of the application~~
