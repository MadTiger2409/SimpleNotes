## SimpleNotes
"Simple Notes" is a notepad where you can create, save and read basic notes.

This is a UWP (Universal Windows Platform), targeting Windows 10 Fall Creators Update to use Acrylic Material brushes for UI controls.

The application has a basic implementation of MVVM design pattern. The goal is to remove all the code behind and use things like ICommand interface.

There are some features to add in the future:
~~* Remove all code behind~~
* Add animations
* Redesign GUI layer of the application
* Add triggers to create adaptive UI
* Add async saving, so app will save the notes if any value has changed
