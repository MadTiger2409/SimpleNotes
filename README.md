## SimpleNotes
"Simple Notes" is a notepad where you can create, save and read basic notes.

This is a UWP (Universal Windows Platform), targeting Windows 10 Fall Creators Update to use Acrylic Material brushes for UI controls.

The application has a basic implementation of MVVM design pattern.

There are some features to add in the future:
* ~~Implement ICommand~~
* ~~Remove all code behind~~
* Create new application icon
* ~~Redesign GUI layer of the application~~
